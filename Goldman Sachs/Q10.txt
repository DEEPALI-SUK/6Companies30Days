First create a min priority queue of size 10 and insert first 10 numbers. 
Then iterate a loop for the remaining numbers and for each number see wether it is greater than
the top element of priority queue or not. If the number is greater than the top element
pop the top element and insert this element. After the completition of the for loop the priority queue contains
the result.
